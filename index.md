# MaterialXJSON

This is the home page for the `materialxjson` Python package which provides support to conversion to / from JSON of MaterialX documents.

This package provides a JSON data representation that can represent MaterialX fully. The JSON representation is targeted at integrations which prefer to use JSON as a data exchange format instead of XML.

The package can be downloaded from **[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/materialxjson)**
